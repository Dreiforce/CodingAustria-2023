Impact â€“ Better communication
The Vienna Red Cross and its employees are on duty in Vienna every day, often organizing the 
safety for major events, but also active when critical events happen and a quick response is 
required. Communication is an important factor in carrying out an operation quickly, 
successfully and safely.

Challenge:
In noisy environments it is often difficult to convey information and instructions by voice 
(among emergency responders). What options does current technology or algorithms offer for 
better processing of verbal messages or how can emergency services communicate with each 
other at a scene faster and more efficiently?
